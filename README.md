## Project Summary
This analysis examines **39 key AI tools** launched between 2017 and 2024. The goal was to provide data-driven insights on launch trends, market valuation, and user popularity across different AI categories (Chatbots, Image Generators, LLMs, etc.).

## Key Findings

1.  **Launch Peak:** The market experienced its highest volume of tool launches in **2023** (14 new tools). The sharp drop in 2024 suggests a shift toward market consolidation.
2.  **Dominance:** The **Chatbot** category is the most frequent tool type, and the market's total value is heavily concentrated in a few top LLMs (**ChatGPT at $85 Billion, Gemini at $15 Billion**).
3.  **Popularity:** **Image Generators** show the highest average user satisfaction score (7.7), closely followed by Chatbots (7.5).
4.  **Market Reality:** High-chatter tools like Grok have a substantially lower popularity score (6.5) than the leaders, highlighting the difference between social media hype and real user adoption.
